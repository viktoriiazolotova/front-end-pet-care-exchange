## How to Use the App
To use the app, you can register as a petsitter and create a pet profile. Once your profile is created, other pet owners in your community can search for you by city name and contact you to exchange pet care services.

## Technology Stack
PetCareExchange was built using React.js for the frontend, Bootstrap for the UI components, and Django for the backend. React.js was chosen for its simplicity and speed of development, while Bootstrap was used for its pre-built UI components that helped speed up the frontend development process. Django was chosen for its powerful ORM and built-in admin interface.

## Future Enhancements
- **User login and authorization:** Implement a user authentication and authorization system, allowing users to create accounts and securely log in to the platform.
- **Credit System:** Introduce a credit system to the app, where users can earn or purchase credits by providing services to other pet owners.
- **Message System:** Implement a messaging feature that allows pet owners and sitters to communicate with each other within the app.
- **Reservation System:** Create a reservation system where pet owners can reserve an available pet sitter and receive confirmation of the reservation via email.
These future enhancements will improve the functionality and usability of PetCareExchange, and make the platform more efficient and convenient for pet owners and sitters alike.
